		<h2> Jirachi Banned from Doubles OU </h2>
			<b><i>May 14th, 2017</b></i>

		<p>
			With access to drawback-free redirection in Follow Me and a variety of speed control options, high bulk, and a fantastic defensive typing, Jirachi had a ton going for it in Doubles. The ability to control turns by manipulating either the foe's target or its Speed made Jirachi overwhelming for many teambuilds, allowing its teammates to set up freely or attack without fear of taking damage.

		<h2> Metagross Speed Shift leads to Quick Ban </h2>
			<b><i>April 30th, 2017</b></i>

		<p>
			Mega Metagross's positive traits are numerous, and it's easy to see why it was a suspect-worthy threat. It possesses tremendous bulk, thanks to its typing and base stats. This made it easier for Mega Metagross to find opportunities to switch in and do damage, compared to "glass cannon" threats, such as Pheromosa and Greninja. Additionally, Mega Metagross has a fantastic Speed tier of 110. The test was on the more controversial side, and the final ban percentage is a reflection of this, with a final tally of 63% of the voting populace voting ban.

		<h2> Pheromosa's Transition to Ubers </h2>
			<b><i>April 30th, 2017</b></i>

		<p>
			Upon the reveal of the base stats from the datamine of Sun and Moon, Pheromosa immediately stood out. Ultra Beasts as a group had some unique stat distributions, with some of them (Xurkitree, Guzzlord, Kartana, Pheromosa, and Nihilego) receiving very uneven distributions. It possessed a sky-high base 151 Speed stat, blowing away almost the entire OU metagame unboosted. When the time finally came for Pheromosa's reckoning, there was little to discuss. Pheromosa was banned with a 92% ban percentage, one of the highest in the history of OU suspect testing.
